Trivia

This is the eighth project of the CS50x course.
The goal is to create an interactive trivia webpage where users can answer both multiple-choice and free-response questions.
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to interact with questions and receive immediate feedback on their answers.

What it does

Displays multiple-choice trivia questions.
Displays text-based free-response questions.
Provides immediate feedback: correct answers turn green, incorrect answers turn red.
Allows easy customization by adding more questions or changing styles.

How to use

Open the index.html file in your browser, or run a local server in the project directory using http-server for testing.
Answer the multiple-choice questions by clicking the buttons.
Answer the free-response questions by typing your answer and clicking the confirmation button.
Correct answers will turn green with a “Correct!” message, and incorrect answers will turn red with an “Incorrect” message.
